# Arras WordPress Theme

## Overview
Arras is a sophisticated, yet simple and clean WordPress theme for magazine/news blogs with the following features:

* Homepage comes with a featured slideshow and 3 featured post areas with 4 different customizable layouts.
* Comes with one-, two- and three-column layouts and 7 different alternate styles.
* WordPress 3.0-ready with two menu locations, custom post types and custom taxonomies support.
* Child theme ready with numerous action and filter hooks available for use.

## History
Arras was originally released as a Premium WordPress theme.
In 2009 it was released as a public project on GitHub by Lead Developer, Melvin Lee (@zyml).

Lee's team worked on the project from 2009 - 2012, and started a second project, AR2, that was released as Arras 2.0 in 2012.
The last commit was May 21, 2013, but a new version was never released.

As of May 1, 2014 the theme's website, http://www.arrastheme.com, announced that the developers were discontinuing the project, and releasing it to any interested parties for further development under the *GNU General Public License v2*. Inquiries were referred to a Google groups page (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arras-theme) for assistance, and to the project on Github.

## Resumed Development at iCaspar Web Development
As it happens, a few of my clients obtained the Arras theme several years ago. Though they like the theme, it has become increasingly unstable as WordPress has been updated but the theme has not. Left without support, (as were many others) I am accepting the former developer's (@zyml) invitation to resume development of the theme.

**iCaspar Web Development is undertaking this project as an open source project without any warrantee that development will continue, or that the results will be fit for use by anyone for any purpose. iCaspar Web Development is not affiliated with, nor do I have contact with, any previous developers of the Arras theme, nor have I received any payment or benefits from the former developers, other than the GNU licensed code itself.**

## Version 1.5.4
This version restarts the project from Arras 1.5.3-RC1, including the changes and updates committed by @zyml, et al, through August 2012. As such, it should be treated as a prerelease (alpha).
I have preliminarily tested it on a development server running WP3.9 (php 5.5). As of this release, all I can say for certain is that it runs with basic features that were present in version 1.5.3.

## Immediate Project Priorities, Support and Future Development
### Immediate Project Priorities
1. Work through the issues on @zyml's original repo (https://github.com/zyml/arras-theme/issues?milestone=none&state=open).
2. Review code changes and issues on @zyml's AR2 repo (https://github.com/zyml/project-ar2).
3. Bring theme up to date with the current release of WordPress (Currently WP3.9, but realistically this may not happen until WordPress has gone 4.0).
4. Release a stable Arras 3.0 version.

On the way to releasing Arras 3.0, I'll probably be releasing minor updates. If you're using the theme with your own modifications, [please use a child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) to avoid losing your customizations.

### Support
You can open an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/iCaspar/arras/issues), or contact me by email (caspar@iCasparWebDevelopment.com). You can also leave a post on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/arras-theme) set up by the former developers. I can't guarantee a solution to every problem you may encounter, but I'll see what I can do.

If you're an Arras fan and want to contribute, I welcome any help and suggestions from anyone who wants to contribute.

Please keep in mind that I didn't code this (so it's going to take some time to figure out what everything does), and I'm not affiliated with any of the previous developers. If you paid for/donated to the theme in the past and are unhappy with the way you were treated in the past, that's on them. I'm in the same boat with you and I'm doing this on my own time, so please be nice!

### Future Development
If you have an idea for future development or new features, I'm open to suggestions. Do so by opening an issue at GitHub, or emailing me.

## Other Languages
Arras has been translated or partially translated into several languages. If you're interested in helping with translation, please drop me a line.
